I'm an [experienced web developer](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewgatenby) working for the award winning [ecommerce ](http://www.visualsoft.co.uk/) specialists Visualsoft.

I work to promote sustainable new development, as well as supporting maintenance and optimisation work to our core eCommerce platform used by [hundreds of eCommerce clients](http://www.visualsoft.co.uk/portfolio.html). What all that waffle means is that I build the cool behind-the-scenes bits that make eCommerce websites work!

I live in the North East of England and am lucky enough to share every day with my beautiful wife Kelly, our 4 year old son Ethan, new daughter Evie and a hamster called [Elvis](http://twitpic.com/2ut5i9) (edit: RIP).

I have a recent convert to Android (<3 the HTC One), am the proud owner of numerous boxes of "useful" cables and (have in the past) developed an entirely new way of snowboarding that doesn't make a single muscle in your body ache.
